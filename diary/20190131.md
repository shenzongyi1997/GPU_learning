##	GPUWattch establishing

####	Step1

Now, I notice that there is a folder in the GPGPU-Sim folder called 'gpuwattch', and want to compile it first.

Copy it, find some files are missing , thery are mainly in the ./cacti folder, so to cp it.

##	missing files

zongyi@garuda.d2.comp.nus.edu.sg:/home/zongyi/gpuwattch

io.h io.cc const.h		./cacti

visualizer.h/cc			gpgpu-sim/

after that , still cannot compile ![1548915314593](C:\Users\workshop\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1548915314593.png)



###	undefined reference

the first variable, **opt_for_clk** , I find all the places it occur.

Then I assume that it should be in the **globalvar.h**, so I change it and delete the extern.

Learn more about **extern**. it has no original definition. So I delete extern in globalvar.h.

It is good to use **grep -rn "xxx"** to find which file contains the useful information.

**the other reference**, dig into the file , I found that, ParseXML is a class, and its function **parse** needs a parameter---'filepath'. Combined with the manual, I suppose it should be the report .



* as for the Parse, **you have to compile all the .cc/.c together**, otherwise it will occur
