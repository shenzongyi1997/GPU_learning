##  Review
OK with GPGPU-Sim and can run applications in it.
Now we want to combine it with nvprof.
But do not know how to insert nvprof codes into the programs.
So, recommend CUPTIL. Try it today.

##  Today
Speed up GPGPU-Sim, modify it , called SIM2
SIM2 run some parts of DNN on GPU automatically
We do not seperate the DNN program. We change the GPGPU-SIM to SIM2
SIM2 will make some numbers in DNN from exact to appro, and appro on GPGPU-SIM, exact on real GPU

the core difficulty:
how to run one program, some parts on real GPU, some parts on GPGPU-Sim

Jason's idea:
change appro to exact, then run on real GPU(it may reduce the number of instructions)

my idea:
appro on GPGPU-Sim , exact on real hardware

nvprof is not so hard, can use it in command line.
CUPTI documentation is boring, try examples.
