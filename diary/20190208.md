###	 my steps

Following the instructions yesterday Prof.Wong told me, I try to do the following things:

#####	Step1

vim a file in **GPGPU-Sim_dev-half2/build/gcc-5.4.0/cuda-9010/debug$**, called **main.cc**

And add two lines into it.(initialization and cycle)

######	Step2

After that, I will see whether I can compile them. use **g++ -o output main.cc libgpgpusim.a**

####	Step3 

To see whether can compile.

After that, set real parameters from **nvprof** or something else.

###	gdb Debugging

I try to use gdb. Not cuda-gdb.

to run the **NN_float**, we have to **set args 2**

When setting the breakpoint, I try to use

**b init_mcpat** 

it says the symbol does exist now, but can in the future library loaded.

It succeed!

But the config parameter is very long and confusing.
