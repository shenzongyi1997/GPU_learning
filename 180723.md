##  2 parameters
n:number of constrains

d:dimension

the solution area is called "feasible region"

##  Our task is to improve the algorithm
the x axis is n
the y axis is work

##  Goal
GPU version 1st cut

##  Tools
CUDA         thrust

##  Smallest Enclosing Circle
Input:points n
output:circle(center,radius
Ball  Sphere
